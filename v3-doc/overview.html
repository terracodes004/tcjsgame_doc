    <h1>Overview of TCJSgame v3</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>TCJSgame v3</strong> is a lightweight, beginner-friendly JavaScript game engine designed to make 
      creating 2D games on the HTML5 canvas both simple and powerful. Unlike large frameworks such as Phaser 
      or Babylon.js, TCJSgame is intentionally small in size and easy to learn, making it perfect for students, 
      hobbyists, and indie developers who want to build their own games without dealing with unnecessary 
      complexity. With just a few lines of code, you can create shapes, move characters, detect collisions, 
      and manage multiple levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version 3 builds on the foundation of v2 with many important upgrades. These include a fully integrated 
      <em>scene system</em> so you can switch between menus, levels, and cutscenes with ease. It also introduces 
      a <em>camera class</em> that can follow players or scroll smoothly across large maps, making side-scrollers 
      and RPG-style games much easier to develop. The new <em>TileMap system</em> allows developers to build 
      grid-based levels, add and remove tiles, and check for collisions against the player or enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visuals have also been improved. You can now set gradient backgrounds, toggle fullscreen mode, and use 
      sprite sheets for character animation. Combined with physics properties such as gravity, bounce, and 
      acceleration, you have everything you need to create interactive arcade games, puzzles, platformers, or 
      top-down adventures. Input support covers keyboard, mouse, and touch, so your games can run on both 
      desktop and mobile devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The philosophy of TCJSgame is <em>learn fast, build quickly</em>. The API is small enough to memorize, 
      but flexible enough to handle many kinds of projects. Whether you want to build a Flappy Bird clone, 
      a tile-based dungeon crawler, or an original platformer, TCJSgame v3 gives you the tools to get started 
      right away.
